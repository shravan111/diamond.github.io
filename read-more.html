                <p>This document describes how we will process your personal information when you use the products and services provided by Beijing Sixiang United Network Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Sixiang”), including information provided when you use the VC Browser. The following describes our practices of handling VC Browser users’ privacy. In case of any major changes in your privacy policy, we will notify you. When you use the VC Browser, you can always choose not to send any personal information to Sixiang and can disable the browser at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>1.Information that may be received by Sixiang when using VC Browser</strong></p>
                <p>You do not need to provide any personally identifiable information to download and use the VC Browser. When you download a VC Browser or use it to communicate with a Sixiang server, Sixiang receives only standard log information, including your device’s IP address and one or more Cookies. You can configure the VC Browser to not send cookies to Sixiang or other sites as described here.</p>
                <p>Some functions of the VC Browser may send additional qualifiers to Sixiang:</p>
                <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> When you enter a URL or a query in the address bar, VC Browser will send the typed text to your default search engine, which automatically suggests terms or URLs that may suit your needs.</p> 
                <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> If you enable the synchronization function of VC Browser, VC Browser will save your browser configuration information (such as bookmark data) to a Sixiang server and associate it with your Sixiang account. We need to store these settings information in order to send the information to other devices you choose to enable the synchronization function of VC Browser. In addition, you can disable the function as you want.</p> 
                <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> If you enable the optional AutoFill function (which can fill out the web form for you automatically), VC Browser will send Sixiang limited information about the web structure that contains the web form and how the web form is arranged so that we can improve AutoFill function for related pages. Although the information sent by VC Browser may contain information that you typed in the form, it will not send the characters you typed in the field to Sixiang unless you choose to use the synchronization function of VC Browser and save the data through your account. </p> 
                <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> If you enable the Location function of VC Browser (which allows you to share your location with any Web site), VC Browser will send the local network information to Sixiang’s location service to obtain the estimated location. According to the functions of your device, the local network information will include the following information: Relevant information about your nearest Wi-Fi router, the cell ID of your nearest base station, the strength of your Wi-Fi or cell signal and information about your device (such as the IP address of the device). With the information, we can not only handle location requests, but also provide maintenance and support for VC Browser and Sixiang location services, and improve their overall quality. Sixiang will be anonymous at first to handle and gather the information collected above and then use the information to develop new functions, products and services, or to improve the overall quality of any other products and services of Sixiang.</p> 
                <p>You can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Sixiang. Using statistics and crash reports by customers can help us diagnose problems occurred in the browser, to understand what the user is doing with the browser and also to improve the performance of the browser.
VC Browser will contact Sixiang to check for updates automatically.</p>
<p><strong>2. Information that the site operator will receive when accessing the site via VC Browser</strong></p>
<p>The site that you access via VC Browser will receive standard log information automatically, which is similar to the information received by Sixiang. These sites may also set their own cookies on your device or use network storage. You can adjust your preferences in VC Browser to restrict cookies. If you use VC Browser in incognito mode, the browser will not send any legacy cookies to the websites you are visiting. When you use VC Browser in incognito mode, the site you are visiting may store new cookies on your device. If you stay in incognito mode, VC Browser will temporarily store the cookies on your device and send them to the websites you visit. When you close the browser or return to normal browsing mode, VC Browser will delete these cookies.
If you choose to use the location function of VC Browser, you can share your location with the site through the service. We do not allow those sites to obtain your location without your permission. Except Sixiang site, we cannot control any other sites or their practices of handling user privacy. Please learn more about the site’s handling of user privacy before deciding whether to agree to share your location with the site.</p>
<p><strong>3. Information stored on the device when using VC Browser</strong></p>
<p>VC Browser will keep useful information about your browsing history on your device. The useful information includes:</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Basic browsing history information, including the URL of the page you have visited, the cache text file of these pages, and a list of some IP addresses that are linked to the pages you have visited.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> A searchable index of most pages you’ve visited (excluding secure pages that use “https” URLs, such as pages of certain banks).</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Screenshots (in thumbnail size) of most pages you have visited.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Cookie or network storage data (stored on your device from the site you have visited).</p> 

<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Download history of website contents.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> You can delete all or part of the history at any time.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> You can also use the incognito mode to restrict VC Browser from saving information on your device. In the incognito mode, VC Browser will not store basic browsing history information, such as URLs, cached page text, or the IP addresses of the pages on the website that you have visited. When you close the browser or return to normal browsing mode, VC Browser will delete new cookies received from your device in the incognito mode.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> If you make any changes to the browser configuration (such as bookmarking a web page or changing the browser settings), VC Browser will save the information for these changes on your device. These changes are not affected by incognito mode.</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> You can choose to have VC Browser save your password on some websites.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Extensions and plug-ins of VC Browser</strong></p>
<p>If you have installed any extension on your VC Browser (that is, the “plug-ins” referred to in the document), these plug-ins can store data locally and send any data it has permission to access to any third-party server it has permission to communicate with. Therefore, you need to confirm very carefully whether you understand and trust the plug-in developers. VC Browser of Sixiang will save a list of all plug-ins on your device and periodically uses the information to check for updates to the plug-ins and automatically download and install updates.
If you install a plug-in via “VC Browser Plug-in Center”, VC Browser will check if any update of the plug-in in your first installation. When you uninstall the plug-in, your browser will send us one or more usage tags. These usage tags include whether you use the associated plug-ins and the number of days since the last similar report was sent. We will use the information to track usage data about the plug-in and rank the plug-ins based on popularity. We will not use the information to identify you or to associate the information with your personal information. 
If you install a plug-in in VC Browser, all data handled by the associated plug-in will be processed according to the policy set by the developer of the plug-in.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use of related information</strong></p>
<p>We will process the information Sixiang receives when you use VC Browser to manage and improve other services of VC Browser and Sixiang. Information received by other website operators is subject to the privacy policies of their respective websites. VC Browser will store the information on your device to improve its performance and provide you with a variety of functions.</p>
<p>6. We will retain your personal information within necessary period for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and within the time limit as required by applicable laws and regulations only.
We will use a variety of security technologies and procedures to protect the information against loss, improper use, unauthorized viewing or disclosure. However, please understand that, due to technical limitations and possible malicious means in the Internet industry, even if we do our best to strengthen security measures, it is impossible to ensure the information is 100% secure all the time. You need to understand that the systems and communication networks you have used to access our services may have problems probably because of factors beyond our control.</p>
<p>7. We may timely revise the terms of Privacy Policy as part of the Privacy Policy. If you continue to use our services although any revisions resulted in a substantial reduction in your rights under the Privacy Policy, it shall be deemed that you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
